This is the QuickFIX/n Core. This package contains the core QF/n engine, but none of the message definitions.

You most likely also need one or more message definition packages:
* If you are using a FIX4 release, you need the corresponding QuickFIXn.FIX4.* package.
* If you are using a FIX5 release, you need the QuickFIXn.FIXT1.1 package **and**
  the corresponding QuickFIXn.FIX50* or package

**This is an official NuGet package from QuickFIXEngine.org.**
